/**
 * Makes a method loggable via {@link com.jcabi.log.Logger}.
 *
 * <p>For example, this {@code load()} method produces a log line
 * on every call:
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Loggable
 * String load(String resource) throws IOException {
 *   return "something";
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>You can configure the level of logging:
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Loggable(Loggable.DEBUG)
 * void save(String resource) throws IOException {
 *   // do something
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Since version 0.7.6, you can specify a maximum execution time limit for
 * a method. If such a limit is reached a logging message will be issued with
 * a {@code WARN} priority. It is a very convenient mechanism for profiling
 * applications in production. Default value of a limit is 1 second.
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Loggable(limit = 2)
 * void save(String resource) throws IOException {
 *   // do something, potentially slow
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Since version 0.7.14 you can change the time unit for the "limit"
 * parameter. Default unit of measurement is a second:
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Loggable(limit = 200, unit = TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
 * void save(String resource) throws IOException {
 *   // do something, potentially slow
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Since version 0.7.17 you can ignore certain exception types, and they
 * won't be logged when thrown. It is very useful when exceptions are used
 * to control flow (which is not a good practice, but is still used in
 * some frameworks, for example in JAX-RS):
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Loggable(ignore = WebApplicationException.class)
 * String get() {
 *   if (not_logged_in()) {
 *     throw new WebApplicationException(forward_to_login_page());
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Since version 0.8 you can mark some exceptions as "always to be ignored",
 * using {@link Loggable.Quiet} annotation.
