/**
 * Schedules the method to run with fixed delay, automatically.
 *
 * <p>For example, you want a method to do something every minute:
 *
 * <pre> &#64;ScheduleWithFixedDelay(delay = 1, unit = TimeUnit.MINUTES)
 * public class Bucket implements Runnable, Closeable {
 *   &#64;Override
 *   void run() {
 *     // do some routine job
 *   }
 *   &#64;Override
 *   void close() {
 *     // close operations
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Execution will be started as soon as you make an instance of the class,
 * and will be stopped when you call {@code close()}:
 *
 * <pre> Bucket bucket = new Bucket();
 * // some time later
 * bucket.close();</pre>
 *
 * <p>In order to be executed the class should implement either
 * {@link Runnable} or {@link java.util.concurrent.Callable}. In order to
 * be closed and stopped, your the class should implement
 * {@link java.io.Closeable} and its {@code close()}
 * method should be explicitly called
 * at the moment you want it to stop.
