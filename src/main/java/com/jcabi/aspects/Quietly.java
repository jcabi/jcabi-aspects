 * Log all exceptions thrown out of this method and swallow them.

 * <p>This annotation should be applied only to methods that return void, in
 * other cases the behavior might be unexpected.
 *
 * @todo #1 This annotation has to be on methods returning void only.
 *  A compile-time APT processor needs to be created that will verify that only
 *  void methods have @Quietly annotations. In runtime it should throw an
 *  exception before executing of method body, if its return type is not void.
