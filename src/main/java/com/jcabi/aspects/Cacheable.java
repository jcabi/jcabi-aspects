/**
 * Makes a method response cacheable in memory for some time.
 *
 * <p>For example, this {@code load()} method loads some data from the network
 * and we want it to cache loaded data for 5 seconds (to avoid delays):
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Cacheable(lifetime = 5, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS)
 * String load(String resource) throws IOException {
 *   return "something";
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>You can cache them forever, which means that once calculated and
 * cached value will never expire (may be a nice alternative to static
 * initializers):
 *
 * <pre> &#64;Cacheable(forever = true)
 * String load(String resource) throws IOException {
 *   return "something";
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Since version 0.7.14 you can also annotate methods that should flush
 * cache of the object.
 *
 * <p>Since 0.7.18 you can control when exactly flushing happens, with
 * {@link Cacheable.FlushBefore} and {@link Cacheable.FlushAfter} annotations
 * ({@link Cacheable.Flush} is deprecated), for example:
 *
 * <pre>public class Page {
 *   &#64;Cacheable
 *   public String get() {
 *     // load data from external source, e.g. the network
 *     return data;
 *   }
 *   &#64;Cacheable.FlushBefore
 *   public void set(String data) {
 *     // save data to the network
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @since 0.7.7
 * @see <a href="http://aspects.jcabi.com">http://aspects.jcabi.com/</a>
