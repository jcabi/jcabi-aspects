Weaving Java Binaries

  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_weaver}Aspect weaving}} is a process
  of modifying binary <<<.class>>> files after compilation in order
  to inject AOP advice at certain join points.

  First of all, you annotate your classes and methods, and then compile. Then
  you run AspectJ weaver which modifies <<<.class>>> files, producing
  new "weaved" versions of them.

  Luckily, these steps can be automated.
  All you need to do to start using our AOP aspects is
  add these two artifacts to your <<<build.gradle.kts>>>:

+--
dependencies {
  implementation("com.jcabi:jcabi-aspects:${latestVersion}")
}
+--

  Then, you use
  {{{https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.freefair.aspectj.post-compile-weaving}post-compile-weaving}}
  plugin which executes AspectJ weaver to modify your <<<.class>>> files:

+--
plugins {
  id("io.freefair.aspectj.post-compile-weaving") version latestVersion
}

dependencies {
  implementation("com.jcabi:jcabi-aspects:${latestVersion}")
  aspect("com.jcabi:jcabi-aspects:${latestVersion}")
}
+--
  Also, don't forget to mark jcabi dependency as <<<aspect>>>

  {{{./example-weaving-eclipse.html}Additional configuration for eclipse 
  users}}.

  That's it. {{{https://www.l3r8y.ru/2024/01/15/how-to-use-jcabi-aspects-with-gradle}Link to original post}}.
