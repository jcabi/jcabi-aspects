Repeating Java methods on exception

  Annotate your methods with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aspects/RetryOnFailure.html}<<<@RetryOnFailure>>>}}
  annotation and in case of exception in the method its execution
  will be repeated a few times:

+--
public class Resource {
  @RetryOnFailure(attempts = 2, delay = 10, verbose = false)
  public String load(URL url) {
    return url.openConnection().getContent();
  }
}
+--

  In an exception occurs the method will retry two times, with a 10 msec
  exponential back-off delay between attempts.

  Since version 0.7.8 you can change time units
  used for delays (milliseconds by default). For example, this method
  will wait for two minutes between attempts:

+--
public class Resource {
  @RetryOnFailure(delay = 2, unit = TimeUnit.MINUTES)
  public String load(URL url) {
    // loading of resource
  }
}
+--

  The mechanism is implemented with AOP/AspectJ. Read
  {{{./index.html}how to integrate it into your <<<pom.xml>>>}}.
