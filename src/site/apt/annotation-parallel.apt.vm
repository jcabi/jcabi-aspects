Executing method in multiple threads

  Methods annotated with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/aspects/Parallel.html}<<<@Parallel>>>}}
  will be executed in multiple threads
  (depending on the <<<threads>>> annotation parameter):

+--
public class FooTest {
  @Test
  public void canProcessInParallel() {
    final Foo foo = new Foo();
    new Runnable() {
      @Override
      @Parallel(threads = 15)
      public void run() {
        foo.process();
      }
    }.run();
  }
}
+--

  The above code will execute the <<<run()>>> method in 15 threads (15 separate
  invocations). As a result, the <<<process()>>> method of the <<<Foo>>> class will also
  be executed in those threads.

  The mechanism is implemented with AOP/AspectJ. Read
  {{{./example-weaving.html}how to integrate it into your <<<pom.xml>>>}}.
