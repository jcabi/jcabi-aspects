 How to disable the entire JSR-303 validation mechanism

  A text resource <<<META-INF/services/javax.validation.spi.ValidationProvider>>>
  must be created, with a single line inside:
  <<<com.jcabi.aspects.FakeValidationProvider>>>. Once this file is found
  in the classpath, JSR-303 engine will use this fake validator provider and no constraints
  will be reported in runtime.

  Of course, the presence of the <<<jcabi-aspects.jar>>> file in the classpath is required.
