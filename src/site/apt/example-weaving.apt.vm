Weaving Java Binaries

  {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_weaver}Aspect weaving}} is a process
  of modifying binary <<<.class>>> files after compilation, in order
  to inject AOP advices at certain join points.

  First of all, you annotate your classes and methods and compile. Then,
  you run AspectJ weaver, which modifies <<<.class>>> files, producing
  new "weaved" versions of them.

  Luckily, these steps can be automated.
  All you need to do to start using our AOP aspects is to
  add these two artifacts to your <<<pom.xml>>>:

+--
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
  <artifactId>jcabi-aspects</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>
  <artifactId>aspectjrt</artifactId>
  <version>1.6.12</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
+--

  Then, you use
  {{{http://plugin.jcabi.com/example-ajc.html}jcabi-maven-plugin}}
  plugin, which executed AspectJ weaver that modifies your <<<.class>>> files:

+--
<project>
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
        <artifactId>jcabi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.8</version>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <goals>
              <goal>ajc</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
</project>
+--

  That's it.
