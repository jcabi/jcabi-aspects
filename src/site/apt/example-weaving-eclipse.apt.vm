Weaving Java Binaries in Eclipse

  After {{{./example-weaving.html}configuring jcabi-maven-plugin}} in your
  <<<pom.xml>>>, Eclipse may report the error:
  <<<Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration:
  com.jcabi:jcabi-maven-plugin:0.12:ajc (execution: default, phase:
  process-classes)>>>

  This can be resolved by adding a new plugin to the <<<pluginManagement>>>
  section of <<<pom.xml>>> as follows:

+--
<pluginManagement>
  <plugins>
    <!--This plugin's configuration is used to store Eclipse m2e settings
      only. It has no influence on the Maven build itself. -->
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.eclipse.m2e</groupId>
      <artifactId>lifecycle-mapping</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.0</version>
      <configuration>
        <lifecycleMappingMetadata>
          <pluginExecutions>
            <pluginExecution>
              <pluginExecutionFilter>
                <groupId>com.jcabi</groupId>
                <artifactId>jcabi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <versionRange>[0.0,)</versionRange>
                <goals>
                  <goal>ajc</goal>
                </goals>
              </pluginExecutionFilter>
              <action>
                <execute />
              </action>
            </pluginExecution>
          </pluginExecutions>
        </lifecycleMappingMetadata>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</pluginManagement>
+--

  Note that adding this section is in addition to defining the <<<plugin>>>
  outside of the <<<pluginManagement>>> element.

  That's it.
